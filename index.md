<p align="justify"> Hey there, thanks for visiting my website! My name is Levin Güver and I am currently a PhD student at University College London, where I am jointly supervised across the Law Faculty and Philosophy Department by <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/people/dr-mark-dsouza">Mark Dsouza</a> and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy/people/professor-john-hyman">John Hyman</a>. I hold a Bachelor of Law and Master of Law from the University of Zurich, the latter of which I graduated as valedictorian. I am also an active member of the <a href="https://idea-lab.uni-graz.at/de/unsere-forschenden/ethik-der-kuenstlichen-intelligenz/">IDea_Lab</a> (formerly known as the <a href="https://www.guiltymindslab.com/">Guilty Minds Lab</a>).</p>


<p align="justify"> My interests are in criminal jurisprudence, broadly construed. I am most passionate about the action-theoretic foundations of criminal law and am currently composing a thesis on puzzles surrounding intention and adjacent concepts, such as consent. I hold auxiliary interests in the philosophy of blame and punishment and the ethics of artificial intelligence. I am also greatly interested in tackling jurisprudential questions from an empirical angle (see <a href="https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/03%20Tobia.pdf">here</a> here for a wonderful review article of what that looks like) and have done some work on biases afflicting causal cognition and, by extension, the law. 

<p align="justify"> In my free time I enjoy lifting weights, running, playing chess, video games, and reading manga.</p>

<p align="justify">If you share any of the above interests, please do get in touch!  :-) </p>

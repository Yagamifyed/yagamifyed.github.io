<p align="justify"> Hey there – thanks for visiting my website! My name is Levin Güver and I hold a Bachelor of Law and Master of Law (<i>summa cum laude</i>) from the University of Zurich, where I was fortunate enough to graduate as valedictorian. I am jointly appointed as a research assistance at both the <a href="https://www.ius.uzh.ch/de/staff/professorships/alphabetical/mahlmann/team/Levin-G%C3%BCver.html">Law Faculty</a> and the <a href="https://www.philosophie.uzh.ch/de/seminar/people/research/ethics_schaber/guever.html">Philosophy Faculty</a>. I am an SNSF funded member of the <a href="https://www.guiltymindslab.com/"><i>Reading Guilty Minds</i></a> group. <p>

<p align="justify"> My main interests lie in legal philosophy, where I am most passionate about the philosophical foundations underlying the criminal law. I am also interested in action theory and occasionally dabble in neuroethics. In my free time I enjoy going to the gym, reading, and playing chess. </p>

<p align="justify">Do not hesitate to message me if there are any questions as concerns my research and teaching, or my CV.    :-) </p>

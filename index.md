<p align="justify"> Hey there, thanks for visiting my website! My name is Levin GÃ¼ver and I am currently a PhD student at University College London, where I am jointly supervised across the Law Faculty and Philosophy Department by <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/people/dr-mark-dsouza">Mark Dsouza</a>, <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy/people/professor-john-hyman">John Hyman</a>, and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/people/professor-kevin-toh">Kevin Toh</a>. I hold a Bachelor of Law and Master of Law from the University of Zurich, the latter of which I graduated as valedictorian. I am also a member of the <a href="https://www.guiltymindslab.com/"><i>Reading Guilty Minds</i></a> group.</p>


<p align="justify"> My interests are in criminal jurisprudence, broadly construed. I am most passionate about the action-theoretic foundations underlying criminal law and am composing a thesis on problems surrounding intentions therein. I hold auxilliary interests in the philosophy of blame and punishment, the legal and psychological dimensions of causation, and the ethics of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p align="justify"> In my free time I enjoy lifting weights, running, playing video games and chess, and reading manga.</p>

<p align="justify">If you share any of the above interests, please do get in touch!  :-) </p>

<p align="justify"> Hey there – thanks for visiting my website! My name is Levin Güver and I hold a Bachelor of Law and Master of Law (<i>summa cum laude</i>) from the University of Zurich, where I was fortunate enough to graduate as valedictorian. I am triply appointed as a research assistant at both the Law Faculty <a href="https://www.ius.uzh.ch/de/staff/professorships/alphabetical/mahlmann/team/Levin-G%C3%BCver.html">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.ius.uzh.ch/en/staff/professorships/alphabetical/summers/person.html">[2]</a> and the Philosophy Department <a href="https://www.philosophie.uzh.ch/de/seminar/people/research/ethics_schaber/guever.html">[3]</a> and am an SNSF funded member of the <a href="https://www.guiltymindslab.com/"><i>Reading Guilty Minds</i></a> group. <p>


<p align="justify"> My main interests lie in legal philosophy, where I am most passionate about the philosophical foundations underlying the criminal law. In that regard, most of my work is in action theory, though I occasionally dabble in neuroethics. In my free time I enjoy going to the gym, reading, and playing chess. </p>

<p align="justify">If you share any of the above interests, please do get in touch!  :-) </p>

## Theses

<p align="justify"> I wrote three Master theses in fulfillment of my degree. <ul>
  <li>In the first, <b><i>Action, Intention, and Criminal Justice</i></b>, I argued in favour of an Anscombian account of action and intention as opposed to the current causalist orthodoxy construing actions as <i>willed bodily motion</i> that spans the criminal law. </li>
  <li>The second thesis was titled <b><i>Causation and Norms</i></b>. In it, I assessed the notion of causation from the lenses of law, philosophy, and psychology, and – by means of several survey-based experiments – uncovered troubling biases in our causal cognition, with severe downstream effects for the law.</li> 
  <li>The third thesis, <b><i>A Vindication of Methodological Plurality in the Law</i></b>, argued that the law ought to take seriously developments in adjacent fields (<i>i.e.</i>, linguistics, philosophy, behavioural economics) and supplement the juridical toolkit with methods native to those.  </li> 
</ul> 
My Bachelor thesis concerned itself with the normative implications of modern neuroscientific findings for the criminal law.

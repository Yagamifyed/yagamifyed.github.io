# Research

### Master theses

I wrote three theses in fulfillment of my degree. 

*Action, Intention, and Criminal Justice*





My research follows along two strands. The first strand can be sorted at the intersection between law and philosophy. 



The second strand concerns the intersection of law and psychology.

### Test





My research follows along two strands. One of these strands is an upcoming field known as Experimental Philosophy. This field concerns itself with some of the foundational questions plaguing us humans since the beginning of time, yet taking a novel approach: using empirical methods native to fields such as cognitive psychology and neuroscience in tandem with the philosopher's armchair. In light of this, I am currently part of a research group led by [Dr. Markus Kneer](https://markuskneer.com/) called *Reading Guilty Minds*, where we try to unravel the mysteries behind mental states such as belief, knowledge and intention, and draw conclusions for fields which concern themselves with these mental states—for example, the law.

The second strand is linked; in a way, it looks at the same issues—mental states, how they come to be and how they influence our actions—from a different point of view, namely that of the criminal law. I try to take a step back from the empirical work and focus on the philosophical and jurisprudential theories regarding action, the mind, and their link. I apply these findings cross-culturally, in light of the rich tradition of both common law and civil law jurisdictions.

My Bachelor's Thesis concerned itself with the normative implications of modern neuroscientific findings for the criminal law.

### Theses

<p align="justify"> I wrote three Master theses in fulfillment of my degree. <ul>
  <li>In the first, <b><i>Action, Intention, and Criminal Justice</i></b>, I argued in favour of an Anscombian account of action and intention as opposed to the current causalist orthodoxy spanning the criminal law, which construes of actions as <i>willed bodily motion</i>. </li>
  <li>The second thesis was titled <b><i>Causation and Norms</i></b>. In it, I assessed the notion of causation from the lenses of law, philosophy, and psychology, and – by means of several survey-based experiments – uncovered troubling biases in our causal cognition, with severe downstream effects for the law.</li> 
  <li>The third thesis, <b><i>A Vindication of Methodological Plurality in the Law</i></b>, argued that the law ought to take seriously developments in adjacent fields (<i>e.g.</i>, linguistics, philosophy, behavioural economics) and supplement the juridical toolkit with methods native to those for a moral holistic and encompassing understanding of what the legal enterprise is about.  </li> 
</ul> 
My Bachelor thesis concerned itself with the normative implications of modern neuroscientific findings for the criminal law. It was published in <i>Cognitio</i> 1, pp. 1–22. The full-text can be found on my Researchgate profile <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336839623_From_Is_to_Ought_How_Scientific_Research_in_the_Field_of_Moral_Cognition_Can_Impact_the_Criminal_Law"> here</a>.</p>

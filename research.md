#### Theses 

<p align="justify"> I wrote three Master theses in fulfillment of my degree. <ul>
  <li>In the first, <b><i>Action, Intention, and Criminal Justice</b></i>, I argued in favour of an Anscombian account of action and intention as opposed to the current causalist orthodoxy construing actions as <i>willed bodily motion</i> that spans the criminal law. </li>
  <li>The second thesis was titled <b><i>Causation and Norms</b></i>. In it, I assessed the notion of causation from the lenses of law, philosophy, and psychology, and – by means of several survey-based experiments – uncovered troubling biases in our causal cognition, with severe downstream effects for the law.</li>
  <li>The third thesis, <b><i>A Vindication of Methodological Plurality in the Law</i></b>, argued that the law ought to take seriously developments in adjacent fields (<i>i.e.</i>, linguistics, philosophy, behavioural economics) and supplement the juridical toolkit with methods native to those.  </li>

My Bachelor thesis concerned itself with the normative implications of modern neuroscientific findings for the criminal law.

 as the foundation of  argued in favour of an Anscombian account of action and intention in criminal la   

Unorthodoxly, I wrote three theses in fulfilment of my degree and am hoping to pursue a career in research. My first thesis was on criminal law theory and theory of action, where I argued in favour of an Anscombian account of action and intention and defended it against the current causalist orthodoxy that spans the law. My second thesis was titled 'Causation and Norms' and stood squarely at the intersection of law, philosophy, and psychology, and in my third thesis, I argued that the law ought to take more seriously insights coming from philosophy and linguistics, and also the empirical disciplines (though I am more critical than most when it comes to the influence, say, neuroscientific findings can have on the law).

My research follows along two strands. One of these strands is an upcoming field known as Experimental Philosophy. This field concerns itself with some of the foundational questions plaguing us humans since the beginning of time, yet taking a novel approach: using empirical methods native to fields such as cognitive psychology and neuroscience in tandem with the philosopher's armchair. In light of this, I am currently part of a research group led by [Dr. Markus Kneer](https://markuskneer.com/) called *Reading Guilty Minds*, where we try to unravel the mysteries behind mental states such as belief, knowledge and intention, and draw conclusions for fields which concern themselves with these mental states—for example, the law.

The second strand is linked; in a way, it looks at the same issues—mental states, how they come to be and how they influence our actions—from a different point of view, namely that of the criminal law. I try to take a step back from the empirical work and focus on the philosophical and jurisprudential theories regarding action, the mind, and their link. I apply these findings cross-culturally, in light of the rich tradition of both common law and civil law jurisdictions.

My Bachelor's Thesis concerned itself with the normative implications of modern neuroscientific findings for the criminal law.

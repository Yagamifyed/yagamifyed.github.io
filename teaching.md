### Current classes

<p align="justify"> This semester, I am returning to the University of Zurich as the Inaugural 'Normz' Teaching Fellow to co-teach a seminar with <a href="https://www.ius.uzh.ch/en/staff/professorships/alphabetical/summers/person.html">Sarah Summers</a> on <strong> Crime, Punishment, and Equality </strong> (Spring 2026). A flyer can be found <a href="https://www.normz.uzh.ch/en/Curricula/Lecture-series/Crime%2C-Punishment-and-Equality.html">here</a>.</p>


### Past classes

<p align="justify"> Recently, I co-caught a course with my friend <a href="https://www.philosophie.phil.fau.de/person/oezbe/">Ufuk Özbe</a> on  <strong>Victor Tadros's <i>Wrongs and Crimes</i></strong> (Winter 2025) at the FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg.</p>

<p align="justify">At UCL, I was involved in both the <b>Laws Connections</b> module, where I led the <strong>Case Study on <i> Fake News and Falsehoods</i></strong> (Term 1, 2023–24, 2024–25), and the <strong> Criminal Law</strong> module (Terms 1–2, 2023–24, 2024–25).</p>

<p align="justify">At the University of Zurich, I have acted as a co-instructor for the seminar <strong>Legal Philosophy and Legal Theory</strong> (Fall 2021), where I taught Mill's <i>Utilitarianism</i> and key texts on the recent debate as to the interrelation of law and neuroscience. I have also tutored a seminar on <strong>Blame and Punishment</strong> (Fall 2021), where we investigated the phenomena of blame and punishment, as well as their interrelation, through the works of contemporary philosophers. Before that, I was a tutor for the graduate-level lecture <strong>Theories of Morality</strong> (Fall 2020) and undergraduate seminar on <strong>Thomas Nagel's <i>The View From Nowhere</i> and <i>The Possibility of Altruism</i></strong> (Spring 2020).</p>

### Past classes

<p align="justify">At the University of Zurich, I have acted as a co-instructor for the seminar <b><i>Legal Philosophy and Legal Theory</i></b> (Fall 21), where I taught Mill's <i>Utilitarianism</i> and key texts on the recent debate as to the interrelation of law and neuroscience (<a href="https://lms.uzh.ch/auth/RepositoryEntry/17070556318/CourseNode/102288776924793">materials</a>). I have also tutored a seminar on <b><i>Blame and Punishment</i></b> (Fall 21), where we investigated the phenomena of blame and punishment, as well as their interrelation, through the works of contemporary philosophers (<a href="https://lms.uzh.ch/auth/RepositoryEntry/17073866296/CourseNode/85421310414617">materials</a>). Before that, I was a tutor for the graduate-level lecture <b><i>Theories of Morality</i></b> (Fall 20, <a href="https://lms.uzh.ch/auth/RepositoryEntry/16827187510/CourseNode/85421310414617">materials</a>) and undergraduate seminar <b><i>Thomas Nagel's</i> The View From Nowhere <i>and </i> The Possibility of Altruism</b> (Spring 20, <a href="https://lms.uzh.ch/auth/RepositoryEntry/16718364774/CourseNode/85421310414617">materials</a>).</p>

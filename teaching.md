### Current classes

<p align="justify"> I will be tutoring two classes again this year: a <b>Case Study on <i>Medical Accidents</i></b> as part of the <b>Laws Connections</b> module (Term 1, 2024–25, <a href="https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/section.php?id=1086793">materials</a>), and <b> Criminal Law</b> (Terms 1–2, 2024–25, <a href="https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=44585">materials</a>).</p>


### Past classes

<p align="justify">At UCL, I was involved in both the <b>Laws Connections</b> module, where I led a <b>Case Study on <i> Fake News and Falsehoods</i></b> (Term 1, 2023–24, <a href="https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=35683">materials</a>), and the <b> Criminal Law</b> module (Terms 1–2, 2023–24, <a href="https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=37738">materials</a>).  </p>

<p align="justify">At the University of Zurich, I have acted as a co-instructor for the seminar <b>Legal Philosophy and Legal Theory</b> (Fall 2021), where I taught Mill's <i>Utilitarianism</i> and key texts on the recent debate as to the interrelation of law and neuroscience (<a href="https://lms.uzh.ch/auth/RepositoryEntry/17070556318/CourseNode/102288776924793">materials</a>). I have also tutored a seminar on <b>Blame and Punishment</b> (Fall 2021), where we investigated the phenomena of blame and punishment, as well as their interrelation, through the works of contemporary philosophers (<a href="https://lms.uzh.ch/auth/RepositoryEntry/17073866296/CourseNode/85421310414617">materials</a>). Before that, I was a tutor for the graduate-level lecture <b>Theories of Morality</b> (Fall 2020, <a href="https://lms.uzh.ch/auth/RepositoryEntry/16827187510/CourseNode/85421310414617">materials</a>) and undergraduate seminar <b>Thomas Nagel's <i>The View From Nowhere</i> and <i>The Possibility of Altruism</i></b> (Spring 2020, <a href="https://lms.uzh.ch/auth/RepositoryEntry/16718364774/CourseNode/85421310414617">materials</a>).</p>
